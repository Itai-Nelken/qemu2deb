# QEMU2DEB Changelog

**DD/MM/YY**

### 23/01/2021
I was struggling to package QEMU to a deb using any tools I knew of.

### 24/01/2021
I found a easy way to package QEMU to a deb, and wrote this script.

### 25/01/2021
Initial upload, lots of bug fixes and quality of life improvements, first 2 releases (0.1.0, 0.1.1)!
at this point the script is fully functional but lacking some features I would like to add to it (like more control over the DEBIAN/control file).
